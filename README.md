# valheimEnhancments

This is my first try at a valheim mod using bepinex/harmonyx.  
The goal is to add a better creative mode to build and play around more freely than the built in tools allow. This is done by adding more commands that can be executed by a player using the console or the chat.

Everything works based on `valheimEnhancmentsCommand` (and by extension `valheimEnhancmentsToggleCommand` & `valheimEnhancmentsChainCommand`) commands that get added to valheims
native command system via `valheimEnhancmentsPlugin.GenerateConsoleCommands`.

It (mostly) worked on the verison I developed on, it might be hit or miss on all future versions.
It was never uploaded anywhere besides this github, is still a development version and is not intended to be distributed anyhwere or be used by anyone but me.
